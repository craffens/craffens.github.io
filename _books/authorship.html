        What did medieval authors know about their world? Were they parochial
        and focused on just their monastery, town, or kingdom? Or were they
        aware of the broader medieval Europe that modern historians write about?
        This collection brings the focus back to medieval authors to see how
        they described their world. While we see that each author certainly had
        their own biases, the vast majority of them did not view the world as
        constrained to their small piece of it. Instead, they talked about the
        wider world, and often they had informants or textual sources that
        informed them about the world, even if they did not visit it themselves.
        This volume shows that they also used similar ideas to create space and
        identity&mdash;whether talking about the desert, the holy land, or food
        practices in their texts. By examining medieval authors and their own
        perceptions of their world, this collection offers a framework for
        discussions of medieval Europe in the twenty-first century.
