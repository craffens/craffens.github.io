      <p>The warp and weft of political and social relationships among the medieval elite were formed by marriages made between
      royal families. Ties of Kinship establishes a new standard for tracking the dynastic marriages of the ruling family of
      Rus´―the descendants of Volodimer (Volodimeroviči). Utilizing a modern scholarly approach and a broad range of primary
      sources from inside and outside Rus´, Christian Raffensperger has created a fully realized picture of the
      Volodimeroviči from the tenth through the twelfth centuries and the first comprehensive, scholarly treatment of the
      subject in English.</p>

      <p>Alongside more than twenty-two genealogical charts with accompanying bibliographic information, this work presents an
      analysis of the Volodimeroviči dynastic marriages with modern interpretations and historical contextualization that
      highlights the importance of Rus´ in a medieval European framework. This study will be used by Slavists, Byzantinists,
      and West European medievalists as the new baseline for research on the Volodimeroviči and their complex web of
      relationships with the world beyond.</p>

      <p class="blurb">Christian Raffensperger gives us a book that has been needed for generations. Anyone who has ventured into the Kyivan
      chronicles and other Russian and western medieval sources immediately becomes disheartened by the maze of names and
      marriages of the Volodimeroviči. Not anymore, thanks to this book. But Ties of Kinship is more than a reference work;
      it is an erudite and ambitious work of interpretive historical scholarship that offers a source-based glimpse of how
      the Kyivan polity fit into a much broader social and political medieval European world. Anyone interested in Russian
      history or medieval Europe will find this work indispensable.</p>
