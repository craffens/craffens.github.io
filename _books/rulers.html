        <i>Rulers and Rulership in the Arc of Medieval Europe</i> challenges the
        dominant paradigm of what rulership is and who rulers are by decentering
        the narrative and providing a broad swath of examples from throughout
        medieval Europe. Within that territory, the prevalent idea of monarchy
        and kingship is overturned in favor of a broad definition of rulership.

        This book will demonstrate to the reader that the way in which medieval
        Europe has been constructed in both the popular and scholarly
        imaginations is incorrect. Instead of a king we have multiple rulers,
        male and female, ruling concurrently. Instead of an independent church
        or a church striving for supremacy under the Gregorian Reform, we have a
        pope and ecclesiastical leaders making deals with secular rulers and an
        in-depth interconnection between the two. Finally, instead of a strong
        centralizing polity growing into statehood we see weak rulers working
        hand in glove with weak subordinates to make the polity as a whole
        function.

        Medievalists, Byzantinists, and Slavists typically operate in isolation
        from one another. They do not read each other's books, or engage with
        each other's work. This book requires engagement from all of them to
        point out that the medieval Europe that they work in is one and the same
        and demands collaboration to best understand it.
