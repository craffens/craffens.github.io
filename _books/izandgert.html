        Rus' is traditionally seen as part of Ukrainian or Russian history, and
        rarely part of medieval European history. This work focuses on two
        well-known Rusian rulers, King Izyaslav and Queen Gertrude, and situates
        them in a larger medieval context. Their story progresses from their
        dynastic marriage, as part of an agreement between the rulers of Rus'
        and Poland; to their rule in Rus', including the power that Gertrude and
        Rusian women were able to wield and their cultural contributions; to
        their travels in Europe during exile, including to Gertrude's family in
        Poland and the German Empire, as well as to the pope himself; and,
        finally, their ultimate fates and their impact on their descendants.

        Through <i>Izyaslav and Gertrude</i>, readers will see the Rusian
        royalty as not an eastern Other, but part of the broader complex of
        medieval European royalty.
