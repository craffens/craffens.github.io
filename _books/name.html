        <i>Name Unknown: The Life of a Rusian Queen</i> offers an example of an
        eastern European queen as a corrective to the western European focus of
        medieval queenship studies.

        Through a chronological approach, this book looks beyond the popular
        biographies of royal women such as Eleanor of Aquitaine and Berengaria
        of Castile and gathers material from sources throughout Europe. It
        engages with modern queenship studies literature to create a collective
        biography of a Rusian queen through the various cycles of her life from
        the marriage of eight-year-old Verkhuslava to the death of the ruler of
        Minsk whose generosity is recorded, but not her name. For medievalists
        interested in women and queens,
        <i>Name Unknown: The Life of a Rusian Queen</i>
        provides an entry point to an area of Europe rarely studied in that
        literature. For Slavists, it presents a way of looking at medieval
        Rusian women that has not yet appeared in this scholarly tradition.
        Ultimately, this biography integrates Rus, and eastern Europe, into the
        medieval world and acts as an important reminder that women are
        essential to our history and thus to our overall understanding of the
        past.

        This book is of great use to students and scholars interested in the
        history of women, queenship, and medieval Europe.
