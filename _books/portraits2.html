        This volume provides a collection of 'imagined lives'&mdash;individuals
        who, no matter their position on the social hierarchy, were crucial to
        the development of medieval Europe and the modern period that followed.

        Based on primary source materials and the latest historical research,
        these literary accounts of otherwise unsourced or under-sourced
        individuals are written by leading scholars in the field. The book's
        approach transcends the limitations of both historical narrative and
        literary fiction, offering a research-informed presentation of real
        people that is enriched by informed speculation and creative
        storytelling. This enriched presentation of the lives of these
        individuals offers the quickest route to understanding medieval culture,
        society, and intellectual thought. Crucially, the book treats the whole
        of Europe, broadly defined: both conventional areas of study such as
        England and France, and also lesser studied but no less important areas
        such as eastern Europe, Iberia, and the Balkans. The reader of
        <i>Portraits of Medieval Europe</i> encounters the diversity present in
        the European past: the resulting portraits&mdash;unique, personal, and
        engaging&mdash;offer not only a wide geographical scope but also
        perspective on the formation of European society in its fullest form.

        This book is accessible and engaging for students new to medieval
        history as well as those wishing to expand their knowledge of medieval
        society.
