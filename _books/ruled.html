        The vast majority of studies on rulership in medieval Europe focus on
        one kingdom; one type of rule; or one type of ruler. This volume
        attempts to break that mold and demonstrate the breadth of medieval
        Europe and the various kinds of rulership within it.

       <i>How Medieval Europe was Ruled</i> aims to demonstrate the multiplicity of
        types of rulers and polities that existed in medieval Europe. The
        contributors discuss not just kings or queens, but countesses, dukes,
        and town leadership. We see that rulers worked collaboratively with one
        another both across political boundaries and within their own borders in
        ways that are not evident in most current studies of kingship, inhibited
        by too narrow a focus. The volume also covers the breadth of medieval
        Europe from Scandinavia in the north to the Italian peninsula in the
        south, Iberia and the Anglo-Normans in the west to Rus, Byzantium and
        the Khazars in the east.

        This book is geared towards a wide audience and thus provides a broad
        base of understanding via a clear explanation of concepts of rule in
        each of the areas that is covered. The book can be utilized in the
        classroom, to enhance the presentation of a medieval Europe survey or to
        discuss rulership more specifically for a region or all of Europe.
        Beyond the classroom, the book is accessible to all scholars who are
        interested in continuing to learn and expand their horizons.
