      <p>Beyond Medieval Europe publishes monographs and edited volumes that evoke medieval Europe’s geographic, cultural, and
      religious diversity, while highlighting the interconnectivity of the entire region, understood in the broadest sense –
      from Dublin to Constantinople, Novgorod to Toledo. The individuals who inhabited this expansive territory built cities,
      cultures, kingdoms, and religions that impacted their locality and the world around them in manifold ways. The series
      is keen to include studies on traditionally underrepresented subjects in Anglophone scholarship (such as medieval
      eastern Europe) and to consider submissions from scholars not natively writing in English in an effort to increase the
      diversity of Anglophone publishing on the greater medieval European world.</p>
