        This is a new history of the region known as Kyivan Rus', a state in
        eastern and northern Europe from the late ninth to the mid-sixteenth
        century that encompassed a variety of polities and peoples, including
        Lithuanian, Polish, Ottoman and others. This account for the first time
        focuses on the history of the region via families, which allows the
        discussion of a wider region and a larger group of people than has been
        possible before. The book examines the development of Rus, Lithuania,
        Muscovy and Tver, and their relations and interconnections with the
        Mongols, Byzantines and many other peoples. This readable yet thoroughly
        scholarly book will appeal to anyone with an interest in the history of
        eastern Europe, a region that is crucial in world politics today.
