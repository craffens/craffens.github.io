      <p><i>Conflict, Bargaining, and Kinship Networks in Medieval Eastern Europe</i> takes the familiar view of Eastern Europe,
      families, and conflicts and stands it on its head. Instead of a world rife with civil war and killing, this book
      presents a relatively structured environment where conflict is engaged in for the purposes of advancing one’s position,
      and where death among the royal families is relatively rare. At the heart of this analysis is the use of situational
      kinship networks—relationships created by elites for the purposes of engaging in conflict with their own kin, but only
      for the duration of a particular conflict. A new image of medieval Eastern Europe, less consumed by civil war and mass
      death, will change the perception of medieval Eastern Europe in the minds of readers. This new perception is essential
      to not only present the past more accurately, but also to allow for medieval Eastern Europe’s integration into the
      larger medieval world as something other than an aberrant other.</p>


      <p class="blurb">Christian Raffensperger gives us a new understanding of conflict in medieval Eastern Europe. He explores the highly
      complex relations between conflict resolution and kinship networks. Original, theoretically innovative, vividly
      written, and well-constructed, this is a path-breaking work shedding considerable light on a key component of medieval
      politics in Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>Florin Curta, University of Florida</p>

      <p class="blurb">Elucidating the necessarily trans-realm, regional nature of haute politique in eleventh- and twelfth-century Eastern
      Europe, with its continuously shifting family alliances within and across the borders of often unstable polities,
      Christian Raffensperger has crafted a meticulously researched, innovative monograph with an originally formulated
      leitmotif-concept—the ‘situational kinship network.’</p>
      <p>David Goldfrank, Georgetown University</p>

      <p class="blurb">Another Raffensperger cannon ball through the conceptual wall between Eastern and Western medieval Europe. <i>Conflict,
      Bargaining, and Kinship Networks in Medieval Eastern Europe</i> takes great strides toward normalizing the history of Rus
      by replacing the image of incessant civil war with a story of bargaining for power through formalized, largely
      bloodless conflict within a relatively stable and functioning polity. Christian Raffensperger shows how in both the
      plastic use of kin networks and levels of conflict the politics of eastern European families resembled that of their
      western European counterparts. Let the walls come down.</p>
      <p>Leonora Neville, University of Wisconsin–Madison</p>

      <p class="blurb">Christian Raffensperger’s book is a major interpretation of medieval politics in Rus’. Raffensperger offers an
      innovative explanation of numerous conflicts among the ruling elite as a tool for bargaining between individuals,
      families, and clans. Raffensperger advances our understanding of kinship politics by convincingly demonstrating how the
      terms of kinship were challenged and negotiated during such conflicts. This study defies modern nationalism and
      isolationism by taking the reader to the fascinating world of medieval kinship networks that crossed national and
      ethnic boundaries.</p>
