        Since Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the history of both
        countries has also become the focus of world public opinion. One aspect
        that becomes particularly clear is the debate that has been going on for
        decades about the history of this region, which we know as
        "Rus"&mdash;and who owns this history.

        In his new book, Christian Raffensperger, an expert in Eastern European
        history at Wittenberg University in Ohio, sheds light on the place of
        Rus' within our European history from the Middle Ages to modern
        times.Because only if we tell the history of the Rus' without
        nationalistic claims and narratives can we better understand them and
        Europe as a whole.
