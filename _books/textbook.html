        Providing an inclusive history of the entire territory and people of
        medieval Europe from 250 to 1450, this volume examines not just the
        political history but the rich social and cultural history, too.

        European history has functioned as a defining force in the modern
        worldview of many countries and their citizens. Whether viewed
        positively or negatively, that history has shaped the world in many
        ways. To understand Europe, it is essential to have a clear view of its
        medieval history. Proceeding from the decline of the Roman Empire, with
        the arrival of Germanic and Turkic peoples, through the development of
        polities in medieval Europe from Iberia to Ireland, Scandinavia to
        Sicily, and all the way to the taiga, European history grows and changes
        over the medieval period which we bring to a close with the final fall
        of Rome, the capture of Constantinople by the Ottomans in 1453.
        Traditional histories of medieval Europe focus primarily on the West.
        This history attempts to include the breadth of the continent, from
        Scandinavia to the Mediterranean and from the Atlantic to the Urals,
        from the nomads of the steppe to the Sami herders in the north and from
        the vernacular literacies of Alfred the Great of Wessex to Boris's
        kingdom in Bulgaria. The chapters pair eastern and western elements to
        help make the point that all of Europe was undergoing changes, not only
        the west, who then pushed those changes onto the east which has been the
        common narrative.

        <i>Medieval Europe 250-1450</i> is essential reading for all students of
        medieval Europe and, in particular, those who wish to understand the
        interactions and parallels between east and west, north and south.
