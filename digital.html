        <p>Digital Humanities has become one of Professor Raffensperger's interests over the course of working on his own project&mdash;the <a href="http://genealogy.obdurodon.org/" target="_blank">Rusian Genealogical Database</a>. This website, which uses a backend XML database, was developed in conjunction with David J. Birnbaum of the University of Pittsburgh. In conjunction with this project, the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute sponsored the development of a genealogy map, as part of their Mapa project, to highlight the interconnectivity of medieval Europe using this dynastic marriage date (for more information see the <a href="http://gis.huri.harvard.edu/historical-atlas/rus-genealogy.html" target="_blank">Rusian Genealogy Map</a>). These applications are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to digital humanities. Collected <a href="https://www.wittenberg.edu/academics/hist/facultystaff/raffensperger/resources.html" target="_blank">here</a> are some of the many Digital Humanities resources and projects that students, and fellow academics both, can use for their own research.</p>
