        Professor Raffensperger obtained his B.A. from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from the
        University of Chicago. His first book, released by Harvard University Press in 2012 and won the Ohio Academy of History
        Publication Award in 2013 and is titled, Reimagining Europe: Kievan Rus’ in the Medieval World, 988–1146. It deals with
        the relationship of Rus’ (the medieval kingdom that will become Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus) to the rest of Europe. It
        focuses on the multiplicity of connections between the ruling family of Rus’ and the other ruling families of medieval
        Europe; including dynastic marriages, religious ties, and trading relationships among other topics. The marital
        connections of the Rusian royal family are the subject of his second book entitled, Ties of Kinship: Genealogy and
        Dynastic Marriage in Kyivan Rus' (Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 2016) which also provides a complete genealogy
        for the Volodimerovichi through the mid–twelfth century (this project has a parallel digital humanities component which
        can be viewed at genealogy.obdurodon.org and is discussed more below). This project has generated recent interest, due
        to the political situation in modern Ukraine and Ties of Kinship was part of Dr. Raffensperger's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/07/were-dutch-voters-right-to-reject-ukraines-e-u-bid-ukraine-has-been-part-of-europe-for-nearly-a-millennium/">editorial</a> at the Washington Post, as well as the subject of an article by the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute.

        During his sabbatical (2013-14), Dr. Raffensperger turned his focus of research to governance of Rus’ and to conflict
        management in medieval eastern Europe. This resulted in two book publications. The first of those, The Kingdom of Rus’
        (ARC Humanities Press 2017) shifts the discussion about Rus’ from a principality or a collection of principalities to
        one kingdom among many in Europe. It discusses how and why the titles came about, and why Rus’ was a kingdom. The
        second book to come out of his sabbatical work focuses on intra–familial conflicts in medieval central and eastern
        Europe, and how families manage those conflicts through the creation of "situational kinship networks," as a way to
        mitigate the effects of the conflicts. This book, Conflict, Bargaining, and Kinship Networks in Medieval Eastern Europe
        (Lexington Books, 2018), not only deals with conflict management, but shifts the perception of medieval eastern
        European polities, Rus’ in particular, as rife with “civil war” or “internecine warfare”, into polities that are
        dealing with conflict among families in proactive ways – deescalating conflict, rather than maximizing body counts. The
        goal of both of these works is to shift the perception of Rus’ in particular as one kingdom among many in medieval
        Europe, rather than a dysfunctional outlier.

        This larger theme is continued in his current research project, “Comparative Political Development in the Arc of
        Medieval Europe” which looks at political culture from Ireland in the north, through Scandinavia and down through
        eastern Europe, all in the period 1000-1300. By examining this zone, often viewed as peripheral to a normative view of
        medieval Europe, we can shift our perception about what is medieval Europe as well as what kind(s) of polities are
        normative; ideally leading to a shift away from an England-centric focus of political development.

        Christian Raffensperger is currently an Associate of the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute as well. He is also
        active in multiple scholarly organizations. He currently serves on the governing board of the Byzantine Studies
        Association of North America and recently on the board for the Ohio Academy of History. He is also a founding member of
        the editorial board for the journal, <a href="https://arc-humanities.org/our-series/arc/tmg/">The Medieval Globe</a>. The Medieval Globe's goal is to bring scholarly
        interconnectivity to our modern understanding of the medieval world.

        Digital Humanities has become one of Professor Raffensperger's interests over the course of working on his own project
        - the <a href="http://genealogy.obdurodon.org/">Rusian Genealogical Database</a>. This website, which uses a backend XML database, was developed in conjunction with
        David J. Birnbaum of the University of Pittsburgh. In conjunction with this project, the Harvard Ukrainian Research
        Institute sponsored the development of a genealogy map, as part of their Mapa project, to highlight the
        interconnectivity of medieval Europe using this dynastic marriage date (for more information see the <a href="http://gis.huri.harvard.edu/historical-atlas/rus-genealogy.html">Rusian Genealogy
        Map</a>). These applications are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to digital humanities. Collected <a href="https://www.wittenberg.edu/academics/hist/facultystaff/raffensperger/resources.html" target="_blank">here</a> are some
        of the many Digital Humanities resources and projects that students, and fellow academics both, can use for their own
        research.
