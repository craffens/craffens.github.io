      Christian Raffensperger's academic goal has remained the same since the
      completion of his PhD at the University of Chicago (2006)&mdash;the
      integration of the medieval polity of Rus into the larger medieval
      European world. This theme is present throughout his research and
      teaching.

      His first book, released by Harvard University Press in 2012, won the Ohio
      Academy of History Publication Award in 2013 and is titled,
      <i
        >Reimagining Europe: Kievan Rus' in the Medieval World,
        988&ndash;1146</i
      >. It focuses on the multiplicity of connections between the ruling family
      of Rus and the other ruling families of medieval Europe; including
      dynastic marriages, religious ties, and trading relationships among other
      topics.

    <br />

      These themes have continued and been developed throughout his other books
      as well. The marital connections of the Rusian royal family were the
      subject of
      <i>Ties of Kinship: Genealogy and Dynastic Marriage in Kyivan Rus'</i>
      (Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 2016), which also provides a
      complete genealogy for the Volodimerovichi (often known as the Riurikids)
      through the mid&ndash;twelfth century. This project also has a parallel
      digital humanities component (developed with the assistance of David
      Birnbaum, U. Pittsburgh)&mdash;the
      <a href="http://genealogy.obdurodon.org/" target="_blank"
        >Rusian Genealogy Database</a
      >; and with the assistance and support of the Harvard Ukrainian Research
      Institute&mdash;
      <a href="https://www.gis.huri.harvard.edu/rus-genealogy" target="_blank"
        >Rus' Genealogy Web Map</a
      >

      Ties with the neighbors of Rus is not just the subject of his 251 class at
      Wittenberg but was brought to life via
      <i
        >Conflict, Bargaining, and Kinship Networks in Medieval Eastern
        Europe</i
      >
      (Lexington Books, 2018) and more recently
      <i>The Ruling Families of Rus'</i> (Reaktion Books, 2023), with Donald
      Ostrowski (Harvard). These books situate Rus as part of medieval Europe
      and work to connect it into its proper place, without focusing on, or
      perpetuating a modern Russo-centric narrative.

      Dr. Raffensperger's recent work has focused on the breadth of medieval
      Europe. His recent
      <i>Rulers and Rulership in the Arc of Medieval Europe</i> (Routledge 2023)
      suggests a rethinking of how we talk about rulers and their polities,
      their relationship with the church, and even such seemingly basic ideas as
      succession and titles by looking at areas spanning an arc stretching from
      Iberia to Ireland, and Scandinavia to Byzantium. That same broad focus is
      inherent in his new textbook, written with Florin Curta (U. Florida):
      <i>Medieval Europe, 250-1453</i> (Routledge, 2025). The book integrates
      material on traditional topics (the Capetians of France) with discussions
      of steppe nomads, pagan Finns, and in depth coverage of the similarities
      across Europe, from Hungary to Portugal.

      The production of the <i>Medieval Europe textbook</i> is an important
      component of Dr. Raffensperger's shift towards classroom-oriented content.
      This was seen already in some of the Digital Humanities projects, and has
      continued in edited collections such as his two Portraits volumes:<i
        >Portraits of Medieval Eastern Europe</i
      >, with Donald Ostrowski (Harvard) (Routledge, 2017) and
      <i>Portraits of Medieval Europe</i>, with E. T. Dailey (Leicester)
      (Routledge, 2023). It is essential when attempting to reshape medieval
      Europe that the audience for that shift is not just professional
      historians but students.

      Similarly, Dr. Raffensperger has written numerous opinion pieces for local
      papers such as the <i>Springfield News-Sun</i>, <i>Dayton Daily News</i>,
      and <i>Columbus Dispatch</i>. He also serves on local boards including the
      board of the Clark County Public Library and that of the Clark County
      Historical Society.
