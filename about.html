Professor Raffensperger obtained his B.A. from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from the University
of Chicago. His first book, released by Harvard University Press, won the Ohio Academy of History Publication Award in 2013
and is titled, “Reimagining Europe: Kievan Rus’ in the Medieval World, 988–1146.” It deals with the relationship of Rus’
(the medieval kingdom that will become Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus) to the rest of Europe. It specifically focuses on the
dynastic marriages made between the ruling family of Rus’, the Volodimerovichi, and the other ruling families of Europe.
These marriages formed a web of connections that tied Rus’ firmly into the fabric of Europe during this period. Those marital
connections are the subject of his second book entitled, “Ties of Kinship: Genealogy and Dynastic Marriage in Kyivan Rus'”
(Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 2016) which also provides a complete genealogy for the Volodimerovichi through the
mid–twelfth century (this project has a parallel digital humanities component which can be viewed at genealogy.obdurodon.org).
This project has generated recent interest, due to the political situation in modern Ukraine and Ties of Kinship was part
of Dr. Raffensperger's editorial at the Washington Post, as well as the subject of an article by the Harvard Ukrainian Research
Institute.

Currently he is at work on a new project focusing on intra–familial conflicts in medieval central and eastern Europe, and
how those families manage those conflicts through the creation of "situational kinship networks," as a way to mitigate the
effects of the conflicts.

Professor Raffensperger was on sabbatical during the 2013-2014 academic year as a Eugene and Daymel Shklar Research Fellow
at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute. He is currently an Associate of the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute as
well. Professor Raffensperger is also active in multiple scholarly organizations. He currently serves on the governing board
of both the Byzantine Studies Association of North America and the Ohio Academy of History. He is also a founding member
of the editorial board for the journal, The Medieval Globe. The Medieval Globe's goal is to bring scholarly interconnectivity
to our modern understanding of the medieval world.

Digital Humanities has become one of Professor Raffensperger's interests over the course of working on his own project -
the Rusian Genealogical Database. This website, which uses a back end XML database was developed in conjunction with David
J. Birnbaum of the University of Pittsburgh. In conjunction with this project, the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute sponsored
the development of a genealogy map, as part of their Mapa project, to highlight the interconnectivity of medieval Europe
using this dynastic marriage date (for more information see the Rusian Genealogy Map). These applications are only the tip
of the iceberg when it comes to digital humanities. Collected here are some of the many Digital Humanities resources and
projects that students, and fellow academics both, can use for their own research.
