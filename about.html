      Christian Raffensperger's academic goal has remained the same since the
      completion of his PhD at the University of Chicago (2006)&mdash;the
      integration of the medieval polity of Rus into the larger medieval
      European world. This theme is present throughout his research and
      teaching.

      His first book, released by Harvard University Press in 2012, won the Ohio
      Academy of History Publication Award in 2013 and is titled,
      <i>Reimagining Europe: Kievan Rus' in the Medieval World, 988–1146</i>. It
      focuses on the multiplicity of connections between the ruling family of
      Rus and the other ruling families of medieval Europe; including dynastic
      marriages, religious ties, and trading relationships among other topics.

      The marital connections of the Rusian royal family are the subject of his
      second book entitled,
      <i>Ties of Kinship: Genealogy and Dynastic Marriage in Kyivan Rus'</i>
      (Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 2016) which also provides a
      complete genealogy for the Volodimerovichi (often known as the Riurikids)
      through the mid–twelfth century. This project has a parallel digital
      humanities component that was developed with Professor David Birnbaum at
      the University of Pittsburgh&mdash;the
      <a href="http://genealogy.obdurodon.org/" target="_blank"
        >Rusian Genealogy Database</a
      >. Additionally, the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute helped fund and
      develop a mapping component to the project which visually displays the
      marriages as part of their MAPA project&mdash;<a

      During his sabbatical in 2013-2014, Professor Raffensperger was resident
      at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute and was able to complete
      formative work on two new book projects. The first of those,
      <i>The Kingdom of Rus'</i> (ARC Humanities Press 2017) shifts the
      discussion about Rus' from a principality or a collection of
      principalities to one kingdom among many in Europe. It discusses how and
      why the titles came about, and why Rus' was a kingdom. This book has
      recently been published in a Russian translation, as well.

    <br />

      The second book to come out of his sabbatical work focuses on
      intrafamilial conflicts in medieval central and eastern Europe, and how
      families manage those conflicts through the creation of "situational
      kinship networks," as a way to mitigate the effects of the conflicts. This
      book,
      <i
        >Conflict, Bargaining, and Kinship Networks in Medieval Eastern
        Europe</i
      >
      (Lexington Books, 2018), not only deals with conflict management, but
      shifts the perception of medieval eastern European polities, Rus' in
      particular, as rife with “civil war” or “internecine warfare”, into
      polities that are dealing with conflict among families in proactive
      ways&mdash;deescalating conflict, rather than maximizing body counts. The
      goal of both of these works is to shift the perception of Rus' in
      particular as one kingdom among many in medieval Europe, rather than a
      dysfunctional outlier.

      During his second sabbatical, Professor Raffensperger worked on two books
      again. The first was a book written in conjunction with Donald Ostrowski
      and entitled, <i>The Ruling Families of Rus'</i> (Reaktion
      Books&mdash;under contract). This book will be part of their Dynasties
      Series, but subverts that framework to look at how individuals and their
      family groups made decisions which undermined the idea of, or even the
      existence of, a dynasty. This book also covers a broad swath of time and
      territory and is not a repeat of a Russian-centric narrative, but
      inclusive of events in southeastern Rus', and Lithuania as well.

      The long-term project that Professor Raffensperger is working to bring to
      fruition is tentatively titled, "Rulers and Rulership in the Arc of
      Medieval Europe, 1000-1200." This expansive volume looks at political
      culture from Ireland in the north, through Scandinavia and down through
      eastern Europe. Political culture in this case is inclusive of titles,
      succession practices, co-rulership, relations with the church, conflict
      among families, and governance. By examining this zone, often viewed as
      peripheral to a normative view of medieval Europe, we can shift our
      perception about what is medieval Europe as well as what kind(s) of
      polities are normative; ideally leading to a shift away from an
      England-centric focus of political development. This is the project as
      well that Professor Raffensperger is working on during his fellowship at
      the National Humanities Center in Spring 2022.

      In addition to these monographs, Professor Raffensperger has edited
      several volumes. Two volumes in particular are devoted to the classroom.
      The first of those was edited with Donald Ostrowski and is entitled,
      <i>Portraits of Medieval Eastern Europe</i> (Routledge 2018). It is a book
      of “imagined lives” which looks at how people from elites to slaves, lived
      their lives in medieval eastern Europe. The second book,
      <i>How Medieval Europe was Ruled</i> (Routledge&mdash;under contract), is
      in progress, but deals with how various polities were ruled in medieval
      Europe; including the medieval Roman Empire, Bulgaria, Norway, Portugal,
      the Khazars, the Plantagenet realm and much more. Both volumes provide a
      diverse look at medieval Europe that stretches it beyond the medieval
      West.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      In that same theme of a broader medieval Europe, Professor Raffensperger
      edited a volume entitled,
      <i>Authorship, Identity, and Worldview in Medieval Europe</i> (Routledge
      2022) which brings together a larger group of scholars to look once more
      at the primary sources to see how they constructed the world around them,
      and how that is different than the way that modern historians and scholars
      have done so.
