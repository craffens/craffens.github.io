  <p>As part of my commitment to service, I am, and have been, a member of editorial boards as well as professional and community organizations.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Editorial board of <a href="https://arc-humanities.org/our-series/arc/tmg/" target="_blank"><i>The Medieval Globe</i></a>, a peer-reviewed journal launched in November 2014. It explores the modes of communication, materials of exchange, and myriad interconnections among regions, communities, and individuals in an era central to human history. <i>TMG</i> promotes scholarship in three related areas of study: the direct and indirect means by which peoples, goods, and ideas came into contact; the deep roots of global developments; the ways in which perceptions of the medieval past have been (and are) constructed around the world.</p></li>

    <li><p>Editorial board of <a href="https://trivent-publishing.eu/61-eastern-european-visual" target="_blank"><i>Eastern European Visual Culture and Byzantium (13th-17th cen.)</i></a>, which explores the art, architecture, and visual culture of regions of the Balkan Peninsula, the Carpathian Mountains, as well as early-modern Russia and Ruthenia between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries. Through historically grounded examinations of the visual and cultural productions of these Eastern European territories, this series highlights the prismatic relationships between local traditions, the Byzantine heritage, and cultural forms adopted from other models. The local artistic productions ought to be considered individually and as part of larger networks, thus revealing the shared heritage of these regions and their indebtedness to artistic models adopted from elsewhere, and especially from Byzantium. In stressing the local specificity and the interconnectedness of these Eastern European geographical areas, this series aims to challenge established perceptions of what constitutes ideological and historical facets of the past, as well as scholarly notions of what can be identified as Byzantine, post-Byzantine, and early modern history, art, and culture.</p></li>

During my tenure as editor we published approximately ten books in the series and had many more manuscripts in preparation. The goal of the series is to publish monographs and edited volumes that evoke medieval Europeâ€™s geographic, cultural, and religious diversity, while highlighting the interconnectivity of the entire region, understood in the broadest sense&mdash;from Dublin to Constantinople, Novgorod to Toledo. The individuals who inhabited this expansive territory built cities, cultures, kingdoms, and religions that impacted their locality and the world around them in manifold ways.</p></li>
