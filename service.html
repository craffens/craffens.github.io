      <p>
        Director of the
        <a href="https://www.wittenberg.edu/ermarth-institute" target="_blank">
          Margaret Ermarth Institute for the Public Humanities</a
        >. The Institute was founded to connect the mission of Wittenberg
        University with actions in the world around us. Specifically, the
        Institute is focused on our own locality, Springfield and Clark County,
        as well as southern Ohio in general. Our main goal is to take the
        important work of learning and educating being done on Wittenberg's
        campus and bring it into the community. The Institute's core tenet is
        that the site of learning is not always in the classroom nor on campus.
        Human beings are learners; education and knowledge are acquired in
        diverse places across our lives.

          >Clark County Historical Society</a

          >Springfield Area Institute for Lifelong Learning</a
        >. The Springfield Area Institute for Lifelong Learning (SAILL) is a
        partnership of USS with Clark State Community College, Clark County
        Historical Society, Wittenberg University, and many others. The mission
        of SAILL is to offer the community a catalog of intellectually
        stimulating education for adults at least 55 years of age that inspires
        congenial discovery and discussion in an informal atmosphere.

            >Eastern European Visual Culture and Byzantium (13th-17th cen.)</i
          ></a
        >, which explores the art, architecture, and visual culture of regions
        of the Balkan Peninsula, the Carpathian Mountains, as well as
        early-modern Russia and Ruthenia between the thirteenth and seventeenth
        centuries. Through historically grounded examinations of the visual and
        cultural productions of these Eastern European territories, this series
        highlights the prismatic relationships between local traditions, the
        Byzantine heritage, and cultural forms adopted from other models. The
        local artistic productions ought to be considered individually and as
        part of larger networks, thus revealing the shared heritage of these
        regions and their indebtedness to artistic models adopted from
        elsewhere, and especially from Byzantium. In stressing the local
        specificity and the interconnectedness of these Eastern European
        geographical areas, this series aims to challenge established
        perceptions of what constitutes ideological and historical facets of the
        past, as well as scholarly notions of what can be identified as
        Byzantine, post-Byzantine, and early modern history, art, and culture.

        modes of communication, materials of exchange, and myriad
        interconnections among regions, communities, and individuals in an era
        central to human history. <i>TMG</i> promotes scholarship in three
        related areas of study: the direct and indirect means by which peoples,
        goods, and ideas came into contact; the deep roots of global
        developments; the ways in which perceptions of the medieval past have
        been (and are) constructed around the world.

          >Beyond Medieval Europe</a
        >
        with ARC Humanities Press. During my tenure as editor we published
        approximately ten books in the series and had many more manuscripts in
        preparation. The goal of the series is to publish monographs and edited
        volumes that evoke medieval Europe's geographic, cultural, and religious
        diversity, while highlighting the interconnectivity of the entire
        region, understood in the broadest sense&mdash;from Dublin to
        Constantinople, Novgorod to Toledo. The individuals who inhabited this
        expansive territory built cities, cultures, kingdoms, and religions that
        impacted their locality and the world around them in manifold ways.
